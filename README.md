# CTF_challenge_July 2024

The objective of this challenge is to claim all the tokens from the `RewardCTF` contract. Place your code solution inside the designated space of the `test_solution` function. It is not required to use cheat codes for solving the challenge. The two `asserts` placed at the bottom of the `test_solution` function need to pass for the issue to be solved correctly.

## Instructions

* Fork the repo with the code base.
* Update the visibility of the forked repo to private
* Create a new file with your name (as in auditone app) in the forked repo
* Build and run the environment with `forge test`
* Solve the challenge and write your attack code in the new file
* Add "AuditOne-Gracious" and “luisAuditOne” as collaborators to your private repo.
