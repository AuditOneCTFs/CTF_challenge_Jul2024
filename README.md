# CTF_challenge_July 2024

The objective of this challenge is to claim tokens from the `RewardCTF` contract by exploiting the signature verification process. Participants must generate a valid signature from the contract's admin. This requires understanding the message hashing and signature process. By successfully generating the necessary signature and calling the `claim` function, participants will be able to solve the challenge.
